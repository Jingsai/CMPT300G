Also note that math questions are very difficult to answer over e-mail. Please restrict those types of questions to class time and office hours. I would also ask that you check this syllabus and other resources on the Canvas site before emailing me; most of the common questions are addressed here.

Assignments cannot be turned in via email.

##### Reference Books (not required)

- [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

<!-- ##### Methodology

This class is a participatory experience. As we discuss the material, I will ask many questions so that you, the student, will be involved in an active classroom discussion. Sometimes the participation will be voluntary. Other times I will call on specific individuals to contribute. You will not be able to listen and take notes passively. I firmly believe that the more you are engaged in the dialogue, the better your chances of success are in the course. It is critical that you become an active participant in the classroom. I will guide the direction of the course and play a steady supporting role, but the real work will—out of necessity—be in your capable hands. -->

##### Attendance/Participation

You are required to be in class every day. If you know you are going to be gone or if there is an illness or other emergency, please send me an email. (You can tell me in person if you'd like, but you will not receive an excused absence in the gradebook until it's officially documented in an email to me.)

If you are not present when attendance is taken, you will be marked absent. Therefore, if you come in late and wish to be marked present, you must let me know in class or send me an email.

<!-- You will also be asked to provide a self-assessment of your engagement and participation in the course throughout the semester. -->

##### Assignments

The homework will consist of questions on paper and python programming assignments that ask you to complete relating to the topics covered in the course.

<!-- ##### Exams

You will have one or two take-home exams at the middle or near the end of this semester. They will both be open-book and taken-home. You will have one or two weeks to complete the exams. -->
##### Project

Your final project will be a project for which you will choose a suitable data set and train a model using deep learning algorithms learned in the course. 

##### Grading

The grade distribution is as follows:

<!-- | Type                     | Percentile |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Assignments              | 50%        |
| Exams                    | 25%        |
| Modeling Project         | 20%        |
| Attendance/Participation | 5%        | -->

| Type                     | Percentile |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Assignments              | 70%        |
| Project                    | 20%        |
| Attendance/Participation | 10%        |

Your letter grade will be based on the following scale:

| Grade | Percentile |
|-------|------------|
| A     | 93%–100%   |
| A-    | 90%–93%    |
| B+    | 88%–90%    |
| B     | 83%–88%    |
| B-    | 80%–83%    |
| C+    | 78%–80%    |
| C     | 73%–78%    |
| C-    | 70%–73%    |
| D+    | 65%–70%    |
| D     | 60%–65%    |
| D-    | 55%–60%    |
| F     | 0%–55%     |

##### Academic Honesty

All work shall comply with the Westminster College academic honesty policy. (See the relevant section in the Academic Catalog.) Cheating will not be tolerated. This includes—but is not limited to—copying assignments, using unauthorized materials in a test, looking at someone else's paper during a test, collaborating with another person during a test, plagiarism, data fabrication, data falsification, and other similar activities. You are all adults and you know what constitutes cheating; therefore, I will never accept an excuse of "I didn't know." If there's any question as to what constitutes cheating, please ask before it becomes a problem. I reserve the right to assess a penalty for cheating as the severity demands. The minimum penalty will be a zero on that particular test or assignment. More likely, though, is that you will receive an "F" in the class. You will also be reported to the dean for any violation. Having said that, I encourage you to work together on the assignments (this is not the same thing as copying another's completed assignment) and study together for tests.
